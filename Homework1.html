    <h1> About me</h1>
    <p> My name's Graham. This is my 5th year at the University of MT</p>
    <p>I'm Majoring in Media Arts and just recently completed my Minor in Music</p>
    <p> I might be graduating either fall 2023 or spring 2024</p> 
    <p> I prefer to keep this HTML simple, it's been over a year since I did coding</p> 
    <p> I'm Video Editor, and play Trombone, not much else though.</p>

    <h1> Challenges</h1> 
<p> I think for me my main challenge is trying to find motivation to keep doing what I'm doing</p> 
<p> Sometimes I feel like my work always falls short, or in other words it almost never pays off</p> 
<p> Coding is not my strongsuit, there's always something so goddamn small that I always seem to overlook</p> 
<p> So I do apologise that it's not the most pleasing site, but I'll slowly try to find a way to make it acceptable</p>
