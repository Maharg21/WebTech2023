Homework 1
Well, it's been over a year since I wrote an HTML site, I'm pretty sure I missed a couple of things. I prefered to keep it simple and not complicate things, because I've added some things in the code and something goes wrong and I can't figure out what it is.

Also, I'm having issues getting my Github to activate. It says my Jekyll converter couldn't convert in a file or directory, so I can't verify it. I don't know if it's a syntax error or I completely miss something (as I always do). 
I do apologise my site is very bland and boring looking, just trying to slowly ease my way back in this environment again. 

Do let me know if I missed something or if there's something that I can make change to make it more interesting.
