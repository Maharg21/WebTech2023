Yet again, I keep encountering issues trying to get things to work. So upon attempting to run the "planet.json foler", the console log blocked it because of the "CORS policy", which I don't know what that means and I'm really in no mood to find out.
But I do apologize again for submitting another broken site. I tried very hard looking over the examples, making sure everything was written right (no errors this time). There are a few undefined variables also, but 
I don't really know where to find/put the variables in without going through so much trial and error. I'm really mentally exhausted, I really need a break.
