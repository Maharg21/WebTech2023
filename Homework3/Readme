I was running out of time, and really didn't have the mental capacity of dealing with the vast array of issues I would encounter creating a choose your own adventure
thing, so I just did a short one-question quiz, and apologies if I don't have every requirement asked. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to get this one True or False question
to work and I have no idea why it won't show what you got when you choose your answer. I applied two separate functions to the specific buttons and nothing happens when 
you click on one of the buttons. I tried looking up online, nothing seemed out of the ordinary for what I did. 

Do let me know if there was something obvious I missed
