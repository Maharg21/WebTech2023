I was running out of time, and really didn't have the mental capacity of dealing with the vast array of issues I would encounter creating a choose your own adventure
thing, so I just did a short one-question quiz, and apologies if I don't have every requirement asked. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to get this one True or False question
to work and I have no idea why it won't show what you got when you choose your answer. I applied two separate functions to the specific buttons and nothing happens when 
you click on either of them. I tried looking up online, nothing seemed out of the ordinary for what I did. I tried applying a " .innerhtml", which I think is the closest reason
why it won't work, but I'm unsure what to put in it's place if it is.

Do let me know if there was something obvious I missed. I'm still very rusty from Creative Coding 1.
