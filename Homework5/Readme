I feel like I'm getting back in the hang of things with writing the code down, however I'm still getting errors and spending way too much time trying to 
find out what's causing them. Luckily I do know what's going on; I'm having difficulty trying to define my onload for my printBlanks function. I implemented a separate
javascript file for the HTML to read and wrote out everything necessary in the example, and yet I don't exactly know why my console log keeps saying it won't define
the onload. The function is all written out, the html has it embedded, still getting the same result trying different things.
Hate to throw in the towel right when I'm getting somewhere, but I've withered a good 2 hours trying to troubleshoot and fix this issue, but again I'm probably missing
something very obvious.
