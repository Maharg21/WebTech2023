So yet again, and I'm sorry I don't seem to be improving each time, but I keep getting issues even though everything's written as it's supposed to (pretty much just repeating the example files with some changes). 
My script file keeps bringing up errors whenever I write down the document ready function, so the whole thing doesn't work as intended. 
I've spent several days trying to find solutions online, re-read and watch the material from the class site, and I'm putting my foot down again unfortunately.
I apologize that it's incredibly broken.
