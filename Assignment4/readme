Had much better luck getting getting everything set up. However I'm still getting issues with the buttons. My prompt doesn't seem to want to work when you type Wander 
or Wait, and I can't get the story to progress. I was using one of the example codes as a reference and I've read over my code a dozen times seeing if there was a label
misspelled or if there was something not attatched, still a bit clueless as to what went wrong.
