So unfortunately, I couldn't download the Phaser library since their site went offline to move hosts right when I decided to work on it, so my html won't work on my end at the moment. 
I did follow very closely to the examples provided so I went with a very similar game to it, nothing unique. I might update this later once the site's back on and I can get the library. 

Hopefully what I have is acceptable, even though I couldn't really see my game at all due to the library issues. I do understand how it works and setting up the variables and whatnot.
